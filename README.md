Endless-Caves is the first game I made in 2015 (in upper secondary) using Python3 and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news). It is a roguelite, deeply inspired by The Binding of Isaac for the style but with a progression between runs. Like in The Binding of Isaac, a run is composed of multiple levels, each made of multiple rooms proceduraly generated. Rooms can contain items, monsters, rocks that you can blow using bombs, or the entrance to the next level. Your character can shoot at enemies, has a health bar, and a mana bar that he can use to cast spells. Spells, armors, and passive abilities can be unlocked using the experience and money you gain when you die at the end of a run. The experience and money acquired are proportionnal to the number of levels you went through.

There are even more game mechanics than what's described here, as the goal was simply to make a "funny" game. This game is "endless" because it is possible to never end a run, the levels will just grow bigger and bigger, with monsters stronger and stronger.

Finally, here's a picture of the game (remember it was done in upper secondary with Paint):
